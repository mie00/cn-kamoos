The included fonts are intended to be exceptionally average—lacking distinguishing stylistic elements and able to overlap well with a wide variety of document fonts.  The base fonts are “Open Sans” and “Libre Baskerville”, each with various edits described below.  Additionally, when distinct variants for the same glyph exist (that cannot be achieved through simple geometric transformations) alternative glyph paths are taken from the glyphs.js file. 

1. Serif + italic
   1. "v" and "w" glyphs replaced with (modified) versions from "Lora Medium 500"
